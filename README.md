# Ball Board

In this game, you play as a creature trying to collect **balls**. You can move from side to side using **tunnels**, but be careful of the **glue pools**! If you enter one, you will be stuck for a few seconds.

The **goal** of the game is to collect as many balls as possible. Once you have collected enough, the game is **over**.
